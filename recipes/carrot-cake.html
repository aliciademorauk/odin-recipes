    </h5>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>260g plain flour</li>
        <li>400g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots (around 250g), peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li><strong>For the chocolate drizzle:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>250ml milk</li>
            <li>30g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>60g caster sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Oil and line the base of a 20cm springform cake tin. Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder together in a large bowl and set aside. Tip the oil, carrots and eggs in a blender and blitz until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the cake tin and give it a shake to get rid of air bubbles. Bake for 45 mins to 1 hr, until a clean knife or skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. If the middle is sticky, put back in the oven for a further 5 mins. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin.</li>
        <li><strong>For the drizzle</strong>, heat the milk, cocoa and sugar in a saucepan over a low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves (about 5 mins), creating a thick, shiny drizzle.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the tin and level the top using a serrated knife, then flip so the bottom becomes the top. Pierce all over using a knife or toothpick and put on a wire rack with a tray or large bowl underneath. Pour the drizzle over the cake in batches until itâ€™s all absorbed. You can reuse any drizzle caught in the tray or bowl. Most of the drizzle should be absorbed.</li>
    </ol>
