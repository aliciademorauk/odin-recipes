    </h5>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 1/4 - 3 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or 8 chicken tenders</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup mushrooms, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sliced almonds, toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rice Pilaf: </strong>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and garlic and let toast for 2 minutes. When the rice is toasted and the garlic is fragrant, add 2 cups of chicken broth and let it come to a boil, lower the heat to low, cover and let the rice cook for 15-20 minutes or until the water dries up. While the rice is cooking, start on the chicken. Let stand for 5 minutes before fluffing the rice with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken: </strong>Season the chicken with a generous sprinkle of salt, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and let cook all the way through, about 4-12 minutes depending on thickness. While the chicken is cooking, zap the green beans in the microwave for 30-45 seconds. When the chicken is cooked, remove to a plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce: </strong>Add the mushrooms to the remaining butter and sauté them for 1-2 minutes or until they soften. Sprinkle the flour and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, stir to coat and let cook for 1 minute. Pour in 1 1/4 cup of chicken broth and the sour cream, use a whisk to help break up any of the flavor bits that may be stuck to the pan. Let the sauce come to a simmer and thicken. It should thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon in about 1-3 minutes, if you prefer your sauce slightly thinner, adjust with the remaining 1/4 cup of broth. Once the broth has reached your desired consistency, taste and adjust seasonings to preference. Add the chicken and beans into the skillet and drizzle with sauce. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and serve immediately with the rice pilaf.</li>
