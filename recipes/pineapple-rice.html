    <h5>
        Pineapple teriyaki chicken with rice is a fun, filling sweet and savory meal. Chunks of juicy chicken are coated with a tangy teriyaki sauce paired with pineapple chunks and a bed of rice, all inside a hollowed pineapple.
    </h5>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small pineapple</li>
        <li>80 ml low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>35 g brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. pineapple juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp. minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>340 g boneless skinless chicken breast, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp. cornflour</li>
        <li>2 tsp. water</li>
        <li>500 g cooked rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced spring onions, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make bowls</strong>: Slice pineapple in half, leaving the stem intact. Slice the fruit around the perimeters, angling your knife towards the middle, then make a few cuts across. Scoop chunks out with a spoon and reserve about 1 tablespoon of pineapple juice for sauce. Chop pineapple into smaller pieces to garnish (or snack on) later.</li>
        <li><strong>Make sauce</strong>: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, pineapple juice, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Season chicken all over with salt. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, heat vegetable oil. Add chicken in an even layer and cook until golden, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on second side, about 3 minutes more. Pour sauce over chicken and bring mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Make slurry</strong>: Whisk together cornflour and water, then stir into sauce. Simmer until sauce is thickened and chicken is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Divide rice and chicken between bowls and garnish with chopped pineapple, sesame seeds and spring onions, if using.</li>
    </ol>
